# learn javascript fundamental

- A **programming language** that makes websites *interactive*.
- HTML = structure üß±
- CSS = style üé®
- JavaScript = brain üß†

üëâ Example: Clicking a button and something happening ‚Üí JS at work.

java script is language which handles the logic of an website think of it like the human brain without the brain the your body is useless 

# To print the output in javscript you need to use this stament

console.log(‚Äùhello‚Äù); 

you can use backtics , single quote and double quote to print any statement in the console 

# To get and alert button in your webpage you can you use

window.alert(‚Äùthis is an error‚Äù);

# By using javascript you can also get the text by not writing it into the index.html by getting the id and class

document.getElementById(‚Äômyhw‚Äô).textcontent = ‚Äúhello‚Äù

document.getElementByClass(‚Äômyh2‚Äô).textcontent = ‚Äúhello‚Äù

# VARIABLE

DEFINITION : Variable is a container that stores values and behaves that it were the value of that content 

In JS, you declare a variable using `let` (you‚Äôll also see `var` and `const`, but `let` is modern and preferred).

- **`let`** ‚Üí modern way to declare a variable (changeable value)
- **`const`** ‚Üí constant, can‚Äôt change value
- **`var`** ‚Üí old style, avoid for now
1. Declration :  let x ;
2. Assignment : x=100;

```jsx
let x; // this is how we declare the variable 
x =100; // this is how we assign value to the variable 
let x =100; // this is how we do both declration and assignment at the same time 
// when we want the input from user we use the the first method that is declration and assignment differently 
//once the variable is declare we cannot use it again it will throw an error 
let x =100 ; // correct 
let x =120; // wrong  the correct way should be let y = 120; 
console.log(x);// you can use like this to print the the value 
// output ; 100

```

# DATA TYPES IN JAVASCRIPT

1. Number 

```jsx
let age = 25;
console.log(age); // This is the numbe datatype 
// output 25 
// if we want to make a sentence out of it like...
console.log("i am ${age} years old");// this is how you you varible inside an senence using ${}
// outout i am 25 years old 

```

If yoy want to see the the data type fo an variable 

```jsx
let age =12;
console.log(typeof age );// by using typeof keyword we can  get the data type of an variable
// output number 
 
 
```

1. STRING 

 string are the sequence of characters whihc also can include numbet in it but we cannto use that numbers for arthmetic operation 

```jsx
let firstname = "pratham "; //this is how string data type look like 
console.log(firstname);// output pratham 
console.log(typeof firstname);// output string 
console.log(`my name is ${firstname}`);// output my name is pratham 
let email ="pratham123@gmail.com";
console.log(`my email is ${email}`); // output my email is pratham123@gmail.com
```

1. Boolean 

Booleans are either true or false typically they are used flags in your program

```jsx
let online = true; // boolearn datatype 
console.log(typeof online);// output boolean
console.log(`bro is onlnine : ${online}`);
// oouput is bro is online : true 
let forsale =true;
console.log(`is this car for sale: ${forsale}`);// output is this car for sale : true 
```

## Simple program to display your information on website using javascript

```jsx
let fullname = "pratham shinde ";
let age = 20;
let isstudent =true;
document.getElementById("p1").textContent=`my name is ${fullname}`;
document.getElementById("p2").textContent=`my age is ${age}`;
document.getElementById("p3").textContent=`are you student  ${isstudent}`;
// outputmy name is pratham shinde

//my age is 20

//are you student true

```
